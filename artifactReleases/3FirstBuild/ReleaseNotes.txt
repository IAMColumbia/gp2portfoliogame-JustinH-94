Release Notes version 3 Final

- Created New Unit:
	- SkilledBuild: Has the ability to build any building the user selects. Designed so that upon being created, a cube is also created, and when the player picks a building. The cube and unit will
	  switch places as to make it look like the unit turned into the base of the building. This triggers and method that has a timer and the longer the timer goes on. The bigger the cube gets until 
	  it finally turns into the building. 
	- The Unit will get destroyed upon building finished being built.
	- Error: Has not been turned into a prefab yet, so newly implemented units wont be have the same functionality as the first unit.
- Created The Selector Box
	- Finished the Selector Box that selects all units within bounds of the green square. Currently they're able to move to specific location designated from Player.
	- Future implementation: Player inputs "A" and Right-Click so that the units will attack enemies if come across any come into field of view of the units.
- Reworking Implementation of instantiating Units and buildings:
	- Previously, previously stayed within the hierarchy of the game and not as prefabs. Because they stayed like that, when the object was destroyed, it wouldn't be able to be instantiated again.
	  Making the gameobject inaccessible. So nearly everything has been become a prefab. 
	- Issue now is getting the UI to work with newly instantiated objects.
- Future Implementations:
	- Some sort of Pattern, but haven't figured out which pattern to use yet. (Thinking Object Pool, but don't think that pattern would be necessary for this)
	- A work on enemy AI system to act as some what of proper AI.
	- Mentioned earlier, Implement player input of "A" and Right-Click
